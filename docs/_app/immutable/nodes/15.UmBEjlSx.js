		factors. We are building a platform that uses causal inference and machine learning to create
		personalized treatment effect models, enabling truly shared and informed decision-making between
		patients and their care teams.</p> <video controls class="svelte-1yuyku6"><source type="video/mp4"/> From Correlations To Causal Understanding <track kind="captions"/></video> <p class="buttons">Our Vision</p> <h2>The Challenge with Today's Data-Driven Medicine</h2> <div class="boxes"><div class="box"><h3>Information Overload</h3> <p>Clinicians and patients are awash in data, but it often lacks clear, actionable meaning for

		"blueprint" of a disease—informed by clinical and biological knowledge—our platform provides <b>explainable AI with guardrails</b>. It allows clinicians and patients to simulate and compare the likely effects of different
		treatment options, enabling truly informed and shared decision-making.</p> <p class="buttons"><a href="/phrt/approach" class="button">Our Approach</a></p> <h2>Join Us in Shaping the Future of Personalized Health</h2> <p>Building this future requires a symphony of expertise.
