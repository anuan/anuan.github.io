		correlations. I.e. they predict outcomes without understanding cause and effect in data.</p> <p class="svelte-rrux5w">Traditional data-driven AI/ML models are developed using healthcare data, typically

As a consequence,</p> <ul class="svelte-rrux5w"><li>models incorporate confounding, dataset bias & algorithm bias</li> <li>models do not transport to different populations and clinical settings</li> <li>models cannot reliably estimate effect of interventions</li> <li>models do not support comparisons of different treatment strategies</li> <li>models do not support “what if” scenarios</li> <li>models are black-box and their predictions are hard to explain</li></ul> <p class="svelte-rrux5w">In summary, the models provide <b class="svelte-rrux5w">limited insights</b> and contain <b class="svelte-rrux5w">potential biases</b>.</p> <h2 class="svelte-rrux5w">Solution</h2> <p class="svelte-rrux5w">The solution is to <b class="svelte-rrux5w">model what drives the data</b>. That is, introduce a causal

		"How long do I have?", "How will this treatment affect my life?" etc. Clinicians populate the
		model with patient data and can query it for various survival and quality of life outcomes. A
		clinician can also pose "what-if" scenarios to understand the prognosis under different
		treatment regimes. This can form the basis of a shared decision-making process where the patient
		and clinician collaborate to find the best treatment regime for the patient.</p> <h2 class="svelte-rrux5w">Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration</h2> <p class="svelte-rrux5w">Causal model development naturally involves multiple key stakeholders and their perspectives.
		From clinicians and scientists to develop the causal story, to clinicians and data scientists to
		mitigate potential sources of confounding and gather data and to eventually building the causal
