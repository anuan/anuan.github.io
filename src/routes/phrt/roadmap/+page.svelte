	<h2>Roadmap</h2>
	<p>We are currently in Phase 1 and actively seeking partners to join us.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Phase 1: Foundation & Proof of Concept (Now - Q2 X)</b>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Goal:</b> Secure key academic and clinical partners and initial seed funding.</li>
				<li>
					<b>Action:</b> Develop the first causal model focused on a single, high-impact disease area
					(e.g., Type 2 Diabetes or a specific cancer subtype).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Outcome:</b> A validated, non-clinical proof-of-concept demonstrating the feasibility and
					power of our causal approach.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Phase 2: Platform Development & Pilot Study (Q3 X - Q4 X)</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Goal:</b> Build the core platform and a functional user interface for clinicians.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Action:</b> Partner with a clinical institution to launch a small-scale pilot study, gathering
					real-world usage data and feedback.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Outcome:</b> A working prototype tested in a clinical setting, with initial data on usability
					and impact.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Phase 3: Validation & Expansion (X)</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Goal:</b> Rigorously validate the platform's predictive accuracy and clinical utility.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Action:</b> Publish findings from the pilot study in a peer-reviewed journal and begin development
					on causal models for two additional disease areas.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Outcome:</b> Strong evidence base to support broader adoption and a more versatile platform.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Phase 4: Scaling & Integration (X and Beyond)</b>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Goal:</b> Scale the platform for wider use.</li>
				<li>
					<b>Action:</b> Pursue regulatory pathways (e.g., SaMD - Software as a Medical Device) and develop
					APIs for integration with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Outcome:</b> A scalable, integrated platform ready to make a significant impact on healthcare
					decisions globally.
				</li>
			</ul>
